EspressoLocator is a web app that has been built around idea of listing independent speciality coffee places and coffee roasters on a map proposed by the worldwide community of coffee lovers. Its intended mission was to improve tracability from the farm to cup, which is important for sustainability and fair trading.

Its B2B value proposition is to make independant coffee shops and roasters more discoverable, increase sales and customer engagement, provide analytical data on independant coffee producers and their distribution paths, that could be of use for strategic planning and consulting by agencies specialising on the coffee market.

The project is retired in 2018 (no longer updated or actively developed), but still accessible at https://espressolocator.app/.

If someone is willing to address https://github.com/espressolocator/telescope-espressolocator/issues/16 to begin with and start contributing, I will be happy to dedicate time to this project too.
